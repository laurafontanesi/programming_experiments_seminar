<div id="part-1-the-elements-of-an-experiment" class="section level1">
<h1>Part 1: The elements of an experiment</h1>
<p>Experimental design allows us to <strong>test hypotheses</strong>,
stated as relationships between two or more variables.</p>
<div id="variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>A proper experimental design allows us to measure the change in a set
of variables that we are interested in (<strong>the
dependent/effect/response/outcome variable(s), DV</strong>) as a
function of changes in a different set of variables that we manipulate
(<strong>the independent/causal/explanatory/predictor variable(s)
IV</strong>).</p>
<p>We may also identify a set of <strong>control variables</strong> to
be held constant (typically, variables we are not interested in), in
order to be sure that the observed changes in the DV are really due to
our manipulations.</p>
<p>A variable that cannot be/is not controlled for but is suspected to
influence the IV is usually referred to as a <strong>confounding
variable</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Latent variables</strong> are variables we are interested in
but can not directly measure, and thus represent via a proxy (e.g., BOLD
response vs.Â brain activity).</p>
<p><em>Example</em> HP: Humans are more accurate and faster in
discriminating near-to vertical lines, compared to near-to horizontal
lines. Design: Testing participantsâ ability in discriminating the
orientation of two bars, one fixed bar A and one varying bar B (DV:
accuracy and response times), manipulating the distance between the 2
bars within blocks and the orientation of the fixed bar between blocks
(IV: orientation difference between stimulus A and B, orientation of
stimulus A in degrees). The temperature in the room or other
environmental distractions might also affect performance but we want to
keep those as constant as possible within/across blocks or experimental
sessions. If the experimenter would systematically tap on the floor as a
function of the difficulty of a task, that would be a confound.</p>
</div>
<div id="types-of-iv" class="section level2">
<h2>Types of IV</h2>
<p>When we manipulate the IV, we alter the values or levels that it
takes (e.g., varying difficulty by setting the orientation difference to
either 10, 20, oe 30 degrees). Where our experiment has a single IV, the
different values or levels of this variable are the
<strong>conditions</strong> of our experiment.</p>
<p>In the simplest case, we have 2 conditions, where we manipulate the
presence and absence of a certain IV (e.g., administering cheese before
sleeping) and test the difference between the DV across these 2
conditions (e.g., measuring the quantity of nighmeares). Such conditions
can be referred to as <em>experimental</em> and <em>control</em>
condition.</p>
<p>One fundamental factor that we have to decide upon, even after we
have determined the precise question we wish to examine, chosen our IV
and DV, and set the levels on the IV, is <em>how we will distribute the
participants</em> across the different conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>we could have different groups of people performing in the different
conditions. The scores on our DV would therefore be from different
samples and be unrelated to each other. Our IV would thus be an
<strong>unrelated samples IV</strong> (<strong>between subject
design</strong>)</li>
<li>we could have the same group of participants performing in the two
conditions. The scores on our DV would therefore be from the same sample
and would be related to each other. Our IV would thus be a
<strong>related samples IV</strong> (<strong>within subject
design</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to consider how you might choose between these types of IV,
you should evaluate which type will ensure that there will be no
confounds. One source of confounding can be our particular sample of
participants. In the cheese example, by assignign one group to the
cheese condition and one to the control condition, you want to make sure
that one group also does not have better/worse sleep or other
<strong>individual differences</strong> that might influence the DV. If
you were to assign both condition to each participants, you want to be
sure to not have any <strong>order effect</strong> (improvement or
deterioration due to practice, but also anchoring, carry-over effects,
interference, etc.).</p>
<p>Advantage of <strong>related samples IV</strong>: In eliminating
individual differences from our experiment, related samples IVs reduce
the amount of background or extraneous variation that we have to cope
with variation other than that arising from our manipulation of the
IV.</p>
<p>Disadvantage of <strong>related samples IV</strong>: When we run an
experiment using related samples, we will have to present our conditions
one after the other. This produces problems that do not exist when we
use unrelated samples.</p>
</div>
<div id="randomization" class="section level2">
<h2>Randomization</h2>
<p>We want to minimize the impact of the confounding variables that can
naturally arise from the choice of the IV (e.g., order/individual
differences effects) as much as possible.</p>
<p>In between-subject designs, you should try to rule out any systematic
bias stemming from such differences between participants. One
possibility would be to try to <em>match</em> your participants in each
group. In order to do this you would need to assess the performances of
your participants prior to running the experiment (i.e., run a pretest).
Often, however, we have neither the resources nor the time to collect
and act upon this information. Under these circumstances, you can
<em>randomly assign participants</em> to each group, trusting the random
sequence to spread individuals who differ in basic ability at the
experimental task more or less equally among the conditions. The more
participants we use, the more effective this procedure is likely to
be.</p>
<p>In within-subject designs, you should <em>counterbalance</em> each
participant who does one particular sequence of conditions, with other
participants who perform the conditions in all the other possible
combinations of orders. If the levels of your IV are many, then
counterbalancing becomes almost impossible. Then, you should rather
randomize the sequence of IV levels across participants.</p>

<p>Read the paper above focusing on their experimental designs, and
reply to the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is/are the main hypothesis(es)?</li>
<li>What are the IV, DV, and control variables?</li>
<li>What kind of manipulations and randomization were done?</li>
<li>Can you recognize any latent variable or confound in this
study?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: The exercises today should be preferably done in
pairs, but you should write down your own answers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="part-2-evaluating-an-experiment" class="section level1">
<h1>Part 2: Evaluating an experiment</h1>
<div id="validity" class="section level2">
<h2>Validity</h2>
<p>Validity is the main extent to which a concept, conclusion or
measurement is well-founded and likely corresponds accurately to the
real world.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External validity (generalizability)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Generalizability is the extent to which the findings generated by
your experiment can be extrapolated. For example, are they relevant to
everybody, regardless of socio-economic class, ethnic group, gender,
age, etc.? Or are they circumscribed in some way â for example, relevant
only to middle-class, white, youngsters of above average
intelligence?</p>
<p>One threat to external validity comes from the conditions that you
imposed on the time, setting and task for the purposes of control.
Another potential limit to external validity stems from your
participants. Are they representative of the group from which you took
them (e.g., students)? Are they representative of a wider range of
people?</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: the validity of this criticism depends on the
variables in question. If the variables that differentiate such
participants from the general public (e.g., age, intelligence, class)
are thought to have some impact on the DV (e.g., reasoning, attitudes),
then the criticism may be valid. However, other variables may not be so
influenced (e.g., motor skills, visual perception).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal validity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Internal validity refers to the extent to which we can relate changes
in the DV to the manipulation of the IV: A well-designed experiment with
no confounding variables is an experiment very high in internal
validity.</p>
<p>To achieve high internal validity, we often need to hold many
extraneous variables constant, thus compromising external validity. For
example, in our cheese and nightmare experiment, the more we introduce
controls for variables that might also produce nightmares, the more we
run the risk that the generalizability of our findings will be limited
by the values at which we hold those vari- ables constant. For example,
if we require people to eat cheese 3 hours before they go to bed, the
findings may not apply to cheese eaten 10 minutes before going to bed.
Likewise, if we restrict ourselves to one type of cheese (say, Cheddar),
the findings may be limited to that type of cheese, or only to hard
cheeses, or only to cheeses made with milk from British cattle, and so
on.</p>
</div>
<div id="reliability" class="section level2">
<h2>Reliability</h2>
<p>Reliability is the overall consistency of a measure. A measure is
said to have a high reliability if it produces similar results under
consistent conditions. Reliability does not imply validity. That is, a
reliable measure that is measuring something consistently is not
necessarily measuring what you want to be measured. For example, while
there are many reliable tests of risk preference, not all of them would
be valid for predicting, say, the number of driving tickets or substance
abuse.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inter-rater reliability</strong> assesses the degree of
agreement between two or more raters in their appraisals. For example, a
person gets a stomach ache and different doctors all give the same
diagnosis.</li>
<li><strong>Test-retest reliability</strong> assesses the degree to
which test scores are consistent from one test administration to the
next. Measurements are gathered from a single rater who uses the same
methods or instruments and the same testing conditions. This includes
<strong>intra-rater reliability</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-method reliability</strong> assesses the degree to
which test scores are consistent when there is a variation in the
methods or instruments used. This allows inter-rater reliability to be
ruled out. When dealing with forms, it may be termed parallel-forms
reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Internal consistency reliability</strong> assesses the
consistency of results across items within a test.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="replicability" class="section level2">
<h2>Replicability</h2>
<p>Reproducibility is a major principle underpinning the scientific
method. For the findings of a study to be reproducible means that
results obtained by an experiment or an observational study or in a
statistical analysis of a data set should be achieved again with a high
degree of reliability when the study is replicated. There are different
kinds of replication but typically replication studies involve different
researchers using the same methodology. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"><em>Only after one
or several such successful replications should a result be recognized as
scientific knowledge</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercise-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Get back to the paper you chose in Part 1. Now, focus on the validity
(both external and internal). What do you think are the major pitfalls
in this experiment (if there are any) and what could help improving
them?</p>
